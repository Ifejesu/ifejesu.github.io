This is the API for the Emed9ja Project. Emed9ja is the project worked on by my group Team-049-Group-A in the #BuildforSDG Challenge.

The project was inspired by the Nigerian Health Sector and the challenges faced when there is need for retrieval of patientsâ€™ health records such as present health status, medical history, health information etc., when making any clinical decision regarding a patient during an emergency medical situation.
